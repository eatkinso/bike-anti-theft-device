# Bike Anti-Theft Device

A portable, concealed device to prevent bike theft and facilitate tracking.

# Lab Notebook Structure

- Each group member has their own markdown notebook to describe the development and debugging process. 
- Daily notebook entries must have a descriptive title and date. 
- Notebook entries referring to specific features, etc should identify the feature by its commit hash. For readability it may be better to embed images (of schematics, test setups, hand sketches etc) in the markdown notebook itself depending on the context.
- Lab notebook entries will not be removed or modified once written down. 
- Lab data, code to generate plots, etc is in a different folder since it is shared. Always save the original data for all trials, even if you only end up using some of the data for the analysis. 

# Development Folder Structure



# Workflow notes 
- VScode is convenient to write and render markdown. 
- TEXstudio is convenient to write and render LaTEX documents for reports, etc. Always save the .tex source to git, not the generated PDF. 
- Always commit the ENTIRE kicad project directory for PCBs. This prevents issues with footprint and symbol libraries 
since the entire project directory includes the backup and symbol rescue files.
