			\begin{enumerate}

			\end{enumerate}  & \begin{enumerate} 
				\item Populate the RF matching network before populating the microcontroller.

\textit{\textbf{Note:}} The LoRa Subsystem does not function as desired. When the radio is set to the TX state, there is no RF output (measured with a spectrum analyzer). Since identical code \textit{does} successfully transmit CW on the Nucleo development board, this is likely due to a hardware error. We have several possible explanations and future solutions for this failure: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Oscillator:} Our PCB had an error in the oscillator footprint, so we instead soldered a through-hole crystal oscillator to the pads. However, this introduces significant parasitic capacitance and/or inductances compared to the original SMD oscillator. This could have caused internal errors in the sensitive PLL for the RF circuitry in the STM32WLCC. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that during testing, querying the radio error status sometimes resulted in PLL Lock error. We were unable to fix this error during the course because we did not have the time or resources to order a new PCB when we discovered the error. \textbf{Solution}: Order a new board with a properly routed SMD oscillator. 
	\item \textbf{Matching Network:} During the debugging process, we depopulated the RF switch and replaced it with a small piece of wire. Since the length of the wire (approx. 4mm) was much smaller than the wavelength at 915 MHz, we assumed this would slightly degrade the VSWR but probably not cause major issues. It is possible that this change actually significantly effected the VSWR and caused the internal PA output of the radio to be destroyed. Additionally, we did not verify the self-resonant frequency of the capacitors and inductors used in the matching network due to time constraints during the part ordering process. This could also have contributed to degrading the VSWR and damaging the internal PA of the STM32WLCC. \textbf{Solution:} Verify that the capacitors and inductors are appropriate for the matching network, and verify the matching network with a VNA before use. 
\end{enumerate}

Additionally, we were also unable to verify Requirement 1 due to the fact that the lab does not have a VNA available.
